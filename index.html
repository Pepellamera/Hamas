                <h2>Ann De Armas</h2>
                <p>Ana Celia de Armas Caso is a Cuban and Spanish actress. 
                   She began her career in Cuba with a leading role in the 
                   romantic drama Una rosa de Francia. At the age of 18, she 
                   moved to Madrid, Spain, and starred in the popular drama El 
                   Internado for six seasons from 2007 to 2010. During her childhood and adolescence,
                   de Armas had no internet access and had limited knowledge of 
                   popular culture beyond Cuba. She was allowed to watch 
                   "20 minutes of cartoons on Saturday and the Sunday movie matinee.
                   "Her family did not own a "video or DVD player"and she watched
                   Hollywood movies in her neighbor's apartment. She memorized and practiced monologues 
                   in front of a mirror, and decided to become an actress when she was 12.
                   In 2002, aged 14, she successfully auditioned to join Havana's National Theatre of Cuba.
                   She sometimes hitchhiked to attend the "rigorous" course.While a student,
                   she filmed three movies. She left the four-year drama course months before presenting her
                   final thesis because Cuban graduates are forbidden from leaving the country
                   without completing three years of mandatory service to the community. At age 18, 
                   with Spanish citizenship through her maternal grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue 
                   an acting career. In her native Cuba, de Armas had a starring role opposite Álex González 
                   in Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón's romantic drama Una rosa de Francia (2006). Cuban actor Jorge Perugorría 
                   suggested that the director consider de Armas for the role, after meeting her while attending a 
                   birthday party with his daughters. The director visited de Armas's drama school and interrupted 
                   the sixteen-year-old during her audition to inform her that the role was hers. She travelled to 
                   Spain as part of a promotional tour for the film and was introduced to Juan Lanja, who would later 
                   become her Spanish agent. She then starred in the movie El edén perdido (2007) and had a supporting 
                   role in Fernando Pérez's Madrigal (2007), filmed at night without the permission of her drama school tutors. At age 18, 
                   de Armas moved to Madrid. Within two weeks of arriving, she met with casting director Luis San Narciso, 
                   who had seen her in Una rosa de Francia.Two months later, he cast her as Carolina in the drama El Internado, 
                   in which she starred for six seasons from 2007 to 2010. The television show, set in a boarding school, became 
                   popular with viewers and made de Armas a celebrity figure in Spain.In a break from filming, she starred in the 
                   successful coming-of-age comedy Mentiras y Gordas (2009).Despite the popularity of El Internado, de Armas felt typecast 
                   and was mainly offered roles as youngsters. She asked to be written out of the show in its second to last season.</p>
